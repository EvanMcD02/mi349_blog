            <p>In 2023, I joined MSU's oldest acapella group: The Spartan Dischords! This experience has been a blast and I've enjoyed every moment of it. 
                When I first started as a newbie in the group, I had to move the piano out during every rehearsal, along with the 
                other newbies in the group. Now, I've been elected as the music director and I run our rehearsals. There are four 
                vocal parts in the Spartan Dischords. Tenor 1, Tenor 2, Baritone, and Bass. I started out as a Baritone, but 
                I sing bass now because we need extra support on low parts. One of my favorite things about this group at MSU is 
                the blend of harmony and humor. We're allowed to make jokes while we're performing on stage, and our goal is to entertain 
                and make people laugh just as much as it is impress people with our vocal talent. We have three shows 
                every year: A christmas concert, a valentines day concert, and our big show at the end of the school year. Each of these 
                concerts has a set of tradition songs as well as new songs that we pick for every concert. For our big show, we perform a 12 minute 
                long medley where we all dress up and each person in the group gets their own solo! Our christmas concert is coming up soon, on December 6th. 
                We've already began working on music for it and we are picking our songs for the show this tuesday! 
                This group has been one of my core experiences 
                at Michigan State and I'll be sad to leave it behind when I graduate next semester..</p>

            <h2>Spartan Marching Band</h2>

            <p>Band has always been a big part of my school experience, all the way through high school. When I was in my senior year of high school, 
                I wanted to be in the Spartan Marching Band. I had found their videos on youtube, and I would spend hours watching them while I was 
                home from school, and even in school. I would see the S moving down the field and I always wanted to march in that S one day. I wasn't 
                even sure if I would get accepted to state because my test scores weren't great and my GPA was pretty average, but I made it in. All that 
                was left to do from there was audition for the band, and I made it in! Now here I am in my senior year of college wrapping up my experience 
                being in the band. It's pretty much shaped my entire college experience. The band meets for pre-season before the school year begins, so it 
                was a great way to find all my friends in school before the school year even started. I got to travel with the band to the peach bowl my freshman
                 year, and I'm hoping to get to go to another bowl game with the band this season as well! Fingers crossed...</p>
