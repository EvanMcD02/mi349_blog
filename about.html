        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Evan McDonnell. I am a Game Developer at Michigan State University. 
            I am majoring in Games and Interactive Media with a minor in Information Technology. 
            I also participate in several student organizations on campus such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spartan Brass</li>
            <li>Spartan Marching Band</li>
            <li>Spartan Dischords Acapella</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am a senior in the university and my expected graduation is Spring of 2025! 
            I want to go into game design and development after I graduate, and eventually I want to create music for video games.</p>
        <p>Music has always been a large passion of mine and it shows in all of my extra groups that I'm a part of on campus. I love arranging music 
            for marching bands, and digital music as well. I play saxophones, trumpet, 
            piano, and ukelele. I also have a strong passion for music theory, 
        and one day I would love to be a well known music composer. </p>
